Welcome to the official GitHub organization for MunchRun!

## About MunchRun

MunchRun is a new food delivery platform being developed for Melbourne, Australia. Our mission is to create a more equitable and sustainable food delivery ecosystem that benefits all stakeholders:

*   **Restaurants:** We empower local, independent restaurants by charging **zero commission fees**.
*   **Drivers:** We provide fair compensation through a dynamic pricing model and a **hybrid minimum earnings guarantee** that rewards performance.
*   **Customers:** We offer a user-friendly app to discover and order from Melbourne's best local food spots, with transparent pricing and a focus on ethical practices.

We believe in supporting our community and building a platform that is both convenient and conscious.

## Our Approach

At MunchRun, we are committed to:

*   **Fairness:**  Ensuring fair compensation for drivers and a level playing field for restaurants.
*   **Transparency:** Being open about our pricing, fees, and how our platform operates.
*   **Sustainability:** Building a long-term, viable business that benefits the Melbourne community.
*   **Innovation:** Continuously improving our technology and services to provide the best possible experience.

## License

## Licensing

MunchRun utilizes a **dual licensing** strategy to balance open-source principles with the flexibility needed for broader adoption and potential commercial partnerships. Most of our codebase is licensed under the permissive **MIT License**, while specific components, particularly those related to our core values of fairness and transparency, are licensed under the **GNU General Public License version 3 (GPLv3)**.

**Please refer to the individual repositories for detailed license information:**

*   Each repository contains either a `LICENSE-MIT` or `LICENSE-GPL` file (or both) that specifies the applicable license terms.
*   Specific directories or modules within a repository may have different licenses, as indicated in their respective README files.

We believe this dual licensing approach allows us to:

*   Encourage contributions and adoption from the wider open-source community.
*   Protect the core principles of fairness and transparency that underpin the MunchRun platform.
*   Provide flexibility for future development and partnerships.

If you have any questions about MunchRun's licensing, please feel free to [contact us](mailto://munchrunlicensing@finneh.xyz).
